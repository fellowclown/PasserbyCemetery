At first, I was doubtful of his claim, but after witnessing his exceptional knowledge of the ancient ruins of ZehPham, I am more inclined to believe him. Lyell appeared to have knowledge beyond what we knew, which strengthens his claims. He has offered to join the excavation group and help us navigate the area with the aim of causing as little damage as possible.",

The tunnels are supported by beams made of both basalt and wood, which is a combination that has piqued my curiosity. Considering how heavy basalt is, I am intrigued by how the ancient people were able to move such large quantities of it and how they managed to carve such a hard mineral.",

The people of Arcania will be able to learn about their ancestors, and the people of Ferngill will be more culturally enriched. It's a win-win situation.

"WillysInformation.07": "None that this old sea dog can remember...Everyone seemed to love that kid.$2#$b#The last time I ever saw the lad, was the day before a storm hit town.$2#$b#Told ‘em to stay indoors, but Rett said something about meeting a girl at the docks that night....$2#$b#Sometimes I feel I should have done something more...$2#$b#After the storm, I went out to the docks and I found his journal. Ended up giving it to Marlon...We all assumed he fell in and didn't resurface because of the strong currents.$2#$b#Do you think, something else could have happened?$2",
"WillysInformation.08": "If he was anything like me at that age, he wouldn't have listened to reason.$2#$b#And I...Can't be certain, but something's not right...$3",
"WillysInformation.09": "How'd you hear of Rett anyway lass?",
"WillysInformation.10": "I can sense these things...Rett's spirit is still around, I'm hoping to help him move on.$3",
"WillysInformation.11": "...I'm hoping you're not right lass...But...I've a feeling you're being honest...I sometimes hear the lad late in the evening...$2#$b#Well I really need to get back to the ol’ fish shop before it gets too dark out...Never liked being out at night.$2",
"WillysInformation.12": "I'll walk you home Willy, I'm really needing the fresh air anyway.",

"NightMarket.18": "It was hard when the family lost him...But, it was hardest on my mother.$3#$b#It's why she's so against me working with spirits...$2#$b#My father dabbled in the same things I do and one day he made a mistake and his soul was pulled into the afterlife by an angry spirit.$3",
"NightMarket.19": "I know she's scared it'll happen to me too, that's why she's so unbearable about my work.$3#$b#But she won't stop me, I know what I'm doing...Way more then my father ever did, I think that's why I'm so determined to help Rett.$3#$b#I'm going to prove to her how skilled I really am...#$b#Maybe then she might be proud of me...$2",
