"Wed.Alan.MidHeart.fall": "Winter always makes me feel nostalgic, and a bit lonely.$2.#$b#But lately, I’m starting to think…#$b#It’ll be easier with a friend like you around$1.",
"Wed.Alan.MidHeart.winter": "This is the best time of year to tinker around with the forge…$2#$b#I just wish my family would approve. I can’t pick up the tongs without seeing their faces.$2.#$e#Things used to be simpler.",

"Mon.Alan.HighHeart.winter": "I managed to find plenty of forage to drop at my little buddies tree house.$1#$b#Their neighbors got a little jealous, so I had to make a second round.

"Sat.Alan.HighHeart.spring": "You ever wanted something cool like a shield that can shift into a sword?#$b#I'm trying to figure out a way to make one. A ring on your pinky doesn't exactly cover much skin.$5",
"Sat.Alan.HighHeart.summer": "I'm curious what Gus has cooking tonight. I gotta snag some recipes from him.$1",
"Sat.Alan.HighHeart.fall": "It's always great cardio chasing Mister Zigzag out of town when he's dumpster diving.$1#$b#The first two times it happens in a week, at least. After that it becomes a vicious cycle.$3",

"Indoor_Day_4.Alan": "I wouldn't mind getting a job, if we're needing the extra income.$1",
"Indoor_Night_0.Alan": "You know, engineering and druid magic really do go well together. At least I think so, technology can be used to help the environment, instead of destroying it.$1",
"Indoor_Night_1.Alan": "I've not done much today, but man I still feel really tired. Maybe it was all that studying I did while you were working.$1",
"Indoor_Night_2.Alan": "When I was a kid, my mother always told me to reach for perfection.$2#$b#But, I don't think that's really possible.$2#$b#Besides, I like being imperfect.$1",

They are largely considered invasive, but residents still will tame them for labor and transportation. The Arcanian Mustang is a large, durable breed and known more for its stamina than its speed. There has been some debate over whether or not to consider them a draft breed.",

They are the only perissodactyl known to typically give birth to twins.",
"FC.Guide.05":"Monsanthropus arkanensis is a mountain-dwelling primate from the island of Arcania. While slow-moving, they are very strong and territorial, only tolerating other adult Durrahs during mating season.

"FC.Guide.08":"Raphus arkanensis is the largest of the still-extant Fern Islands Raphus species; the extinct Great Raphus was slightly larger but lighter.

Although they are solitary animals, they do form family units. While the females are less prone to violence, it is not advised to domesticate the Tuusca, as they tend to be aggressive and highly territorial.",
"FC.Guide.11":"Thylacinus cynocephalus was once found in grasslands, wetlands, and dry eucalyptus forests. However, the Thylacines of Arcania have evolved to survive in tropical forests. They tend to be quiet and nervous in temperament. When captured, many die suddenly, apparently from shock. This is why efforts to domesticate them have been slow.",

"FC.Guide.15":"The region experiences a mild climate characterized by only two seasons: summer and winter. The summers are longer than the winters, and the winter is also relatively mild.",
"FC.Guide.16":"However, when grown in different climates, these plants can be separated into four groups that follow spring, summer, fall and winter. Some of these plants actually thrive better in foreign countries than in their native land",
"FC.Guide.17":"Although winters are generally mild, there are some crops that require the coldest times of the season to grow, and they thrive in frost. Interestingly, these plants seem to grow better in foreign locations that experience all four seasons, which implies that they could be considered invasive.",

In this new theology, the three goddesses are worshiped together as a group. To show their devotion and reverence, the Arcanians offer various items at their altars. These offerings usually include gold, alcohol, and food.",

"FC.Bookcase.ArcaniaHistoryBook":"The story of Arcania begins with an ancient tribe who migrated during the time when glaciers connected continents, making long journeys possible. These tribes left their homeland during the early Stone Age and ventured towards a new, untouched group of islands.^They were the first to settle there and named the three land masses Arcania after their tribe's namesake. This marked the beginning of their colonization efforts in these unexplored lands. However, tensions arose among them, stemming solely from matters of faith. Different families worshiped different goddesses, leading to an inevitable dispute over which deity to worship.^This disagreement over theology caused the people of Arcania to split into three separate tribes, each relocating to different islands. Ruual, to the west, became home to worshippers of Lipheum. Suuwe, to the east, welcomed followers of Arah. Tuuwe, which is situated between Ruual and Suuwe, honored both goddesses. Surprisingly, Tuuwe quickly became a hub of peace and trade among the tribes.^For centuries, the Suuwe and Rual peoples lived apart. But as the population of Arcania declined and dangerous animals and weather threatened their safety, they had to come together. They reunited on the island of Tuuwe to face these challenges as one group. Today, the people of Arcania still live together on this island, showing that unity brings peace amid chaos.",

"GradysNotes.01": "In the early morning, a new person arrived at the archaeological site. He introduced himself as Lyell and stated that he is a descendant of the ancient people that the team is researching. At first, I was doubtful of his claim, but after witnessing his exceptional knowledge of the ancient ruins of ZehPham, I am more inclined to believe him. Lyell appeared to have knowledge beyond what we knew, which strengthens his claims. He has offered to join the excavation group and help us navigate the area with the aim of causing as little damage as possible.",
"GradysNotes.02": "Today we made an incredible discovery. It seems that the village of ZehPham has a network of interconnected tunnels beneath it. The tunnels are supported by beams made of both basalt and wood, which is a combination that has piqued my curiosity. Considering how heavy basalt is, I am intrigued by how the ancient people were able to move such large quantities of it and how they managed to carve such a hard mineral.",
"GradysNotes.03": "The excavation is complete, and we have gained a lot of knowledge. Now, the government of Arcania wants to take over the site, which is fine as it was part of the agreement. The people of Arcania will be able to learn about their ancestors, and the people of Ferngill will be more culturally enriched. It's a win-win situation. Although I wish I could have kept something, we agreed to leave everything at the site for further research by the Arcanian government.",

"Exhibit.33": "Gender to the Arcanian people was not based on physical sex, but was instead based on the height,size and overall strength of the person. These labels of male(Aba) and female(Marah) could change in time and the people believed that children were genderless until they reached a certain age.^Those assigned female at birth were considered taller, heavier and physically stronger. The females of the culture were the warriors, farmers and hard laborers. Those assigned male at birth were considered the shorter, thinner and more agile.The men tended to be in charge of fishing, trading and child rearing. Both genders were equally educated, however the topic of education tended to change once the gender was assigned.^There is also a third and even forth gender in the Arcanian culture. The assignment of sex however, was based on the physical ability of one's personal equipment. Aduliio means one who offers life. Which is translated to male in the republic and the word Aduliia means, one who brings life, which is translated to female. There was also a term for intersex born children, Duliarah, which simply means, one with gods.",///Arcanian Books 1
"Exhibit.34": "Arkanian natives believe that Arah, the earth goddess, created them from the body of a sea snake named Fuurios, Furrios was her son born from her relationship with a fallen star called Sarui. The concept is that Fuurios kept destroying all of Arah's creations out of jealousy, having wanted all her love to himself, so she took him, split his body into two, and created the first humanoids from his flesh as if it were clay.",///Arcanian Books 2
"Exhibit.35": "Arah the Goddess of earth is both male and female. In Arcania she is both the offeror and giver of life. Her mother, Lipheum, is the goddess of our sun. The Arcanian people believe there are many gods and goddesses that all rein over different galaxies. It is unsure how, but the people of Arcania have had knowledge of far off galaxies since the start of the bronze age.",///Arcanian Books 3
